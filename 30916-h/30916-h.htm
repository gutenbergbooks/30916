<p>Long-eared bats obtained by field parties from the University of
Kansas in the Mexican states of Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas,
are found to belong to the species, <i>Myotis evotis</i>, but are not
referable to any named subspecies. They are named and described
as follows:</p>


<p><b>Myotis evotis auriculus</b> new subspecies</p>

<p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;Female, adult, skin and skull; No. 55110, Univ. Kansas Mus. Nat.
Hist.; 10 mi. W and 2 mi. S Piedra, 1200 ft., Sierra de Tamaulipas, Tamaulipas;
9 June 1953; obtained by Gerd H. Heinrich, original number 7061.</p>

<p><i>Distribution.</i>&mdash;Coastal foothills and adjacent mountains of northeastern
México from central Coahuila south and east to central Veracruz.</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>&mdash;Size medium (see measurements), ears small for the species;
color dark, upper parts (<i>j</i>14) Ochraceous-Tawny (color terms are after Ridgway,
Color Standards and Color Nomenclature, Washington, D. C., 1912),
underparts Warm Buff, ears pale; skull large, teeth large, mandible long.</p>

<p><i>Comparison.</i>&mdash;From <i>Myotis evotis evotis</i> (H. Allen), from Colorado, Wyoming,
and Montana, <i>M. e. auriculus</i> differs in: Ears averaging shorter; color
darker and richer; ears paler and contrasting less, in color, with pelage; skull
larger in all measurements taken except that of least interorbital constriction;
forehead, when viewed laterally, rising more abruptly, because frontal region is
more inflated; teeth larger.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;<i>Myotis evotis auriculus</i>, although no larger externally
than <i>M. e. evotis</i>, has a larger skull, which in lateral view has a more
abruptly rising forehead. The teeth, especially the first upper premolars,
of <i>auriculus</i> are noticeably larger than those of <i>evotis</i>. The
first two lower premolars are sub-equal in <i>auriculus</i> whereas in <i>evotis</i>
the first lower premolar usually is larger. The mandible, in relation
to the greatest length of the skull, is longer in <i>auriculus</i> (ratio, 71-74)
than in <i>evotis</i> (ratio, 67-71).</p>

<p>Coahuilan specimens, although assigned to <i>auriculus</i>, are slightly
paler (upper parts (16) Ochraceous-Tawny; underparts (<i>e</i>) Light
Buff) and have less abruptly rising foreheads than do the bats from
Tamaulipas. In these features, the Coahuilan animals are somewhat
intermediate between typical <i>auriculus</i> and <i>evotis</i>. The bat from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
Nuevo León, in both color and degree of slope of forehead, is intermediate
between those from Coahuila and those from Tamaulipas.</p>

<p>A bat from Perote, Veracruz, identified as <i>Myotis evotis chrysonotus</i>
(J. A. Allen) [=<i>M. e. evotis</i>] by Miller and Allen (U. S. Nat.
Mus., Bull. 144:118 and 120-121, May 25, 1928) is here assigned to
<i>M. e. auriculus</i>. Measurements given by these authors indicate that
this bat has a large skull, which is characteristic of this subspecies.
Another specimen, similarly assigned by these authors and from
the San Luis Mountains in northwestern Chihuahua, seems to be
<i>M. e. evotis</i>, although the published measurements (<i>loc. cit.</i>) show
that this bat tends toward <i>auriculus</i> in size of skull and mandible.</p>

<p>All specimens were taken in mist nets stretched over water. Those
from Coahuila were snared over a concrete water tank situated
near the base of low hills in mixed mesquite and chaparral. In
Nuevo León, one bat was netted over a small pond around which
grew some low trees in an intermontane valley in the Sierra Madre
Oriental. In Tamaulipas two bats were caught in a mist net stretched
across a narrow, brush-bordered arroyo in the Sierra de Tamaulipas.
One adult male weighed 7.0 grams; average and extreme weights
of 7 adult, non-pregnant females were 6.8 (5.2-8.0). Females taken
on March 25 and 26 were not pregnant; one obtained on June 20
was lactating. Funds for financing field work were made available
by the Kansas University Endowment Association and the National
Science Foundation.</p>

<p><i>Measurements.</i>&mdash;Measurements, in millimeters, of the holotype and another
female (No. 55111 KU) from the type locality and 3 females (Nos. 44726,
44729-30 KU) from Coahuila, respectively, are: total length, 94, 93, 97, 86, 96;

38.4, 40.2, 37.3, 38.5; greatest length of skull, 16.1, 16.4, 16.2, 15.8, 16.1;
condylobasal length, 15.4, 15.4, 15.6, 15.0, 15.4; zygomatic breadth, 9.7, 9.9,
10.1, 9.4, 9.9; least interorbital constriction, 3.9, 3.8, 3.9, 3.7, 3.7; breadth of
braincase, 7.5, 7.6, 7.5, 7.5, 7.6; occipital depth, 5.9, 5.9, 5.5, 5.7, 5.6; palatal
length, 8.5, 8.7, 8.7, 8.7, 8.9; mastoid breadth, 8.2, 8.4, 8.3, 8.2, 8.3; breadth
across third upper molars, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.1, 6.1; length of maxillary tooth-row,
6.5, 6.5, 6.7, 6.6, 6.6; length of mandible, 11.5, 11.8, 11.9, 11.2, 11.7;
length of mandibular tooth-row, 8.0, 8.0, 8.1, 8.1, 8.1.</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined.</i>&mdash;Total, 8, all in the University of Kansas Museum of
Natural History. Coahuila: 4 mi. W Hacienda La Mariposa, 2300 ft., 5 (2
alcoholics). Nuevo León: Iturbide, 5000 ft., Sierra Madre Oriental, 1.
